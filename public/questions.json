      "question": "What should I do if my circuit breaker keeps tripping?",
      "answer": "A tripping circuit breaker usually indicates that there is an overload or short circuit in the electrical circuit. First, try unplugging some of the devices that are connected to the circuit to reduce the load. If the circuit still trips, you may need to call an electrician to diagnose and fix the problem."

      "question": "Is it safe to use extension cords for long periods of time?",
      "answer": "Extension cords are intended for temporary use and should not be used for long periods of time. Using extension cords for extended periods can present a fire hazard and may overload the circuit. If you need to use an appliance or tool in a location where there is no electrical outlet, it's best to have a new outlet installed. If this is not possible, make sure to use a heavy-duty extension cord that's rated for the device you're using."
