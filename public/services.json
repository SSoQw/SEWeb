At Sellick Electric, we offer two full-service camera options: a hardwired camera system from Ubiquiti and a wireless camera system from Eufy. Our Ubiquiti system is recommended for new construction or existing construction with data wire conduit, as the cameras are hardwired for maximum reliability and security.

If a camera breaks or becomes non-functional, we will handle the replacement process for you. You can compare the two options in the table below.\n\nMonitor your property remotely through your smartphone, tablet, or computer with real-time video feeds and alerts that keep you informed of any suspicious activity. Our advanced camera systems not only provide a strong deterrent to potential intruders but also offer valuable evidence in the event of an incident.\n\nIf you prefer to purchase your own camera system, we are happy to install and configure it for you! Please include the brand and number of cameras in your work proposal.
